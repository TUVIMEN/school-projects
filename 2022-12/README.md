This was assigned as javascript project. We were supposed to make some simple hotel site that had reservation on one of the pages.
It was basically a form with validation that showed price calculated by javascript.
The basic idea was to have amount of days to stay, room size, amount of people, amount of children and checkbox if reservation was with breakfast.
Children would have a discount and breakfast would have a constant price.

As a "inspiration" i've downloaded a couple of pages from some existing hotel and deleted unnecessary html.

I was so successful in this that i've made 2 other such sites, just not for myself and not for free.

Made around 2022-12.
